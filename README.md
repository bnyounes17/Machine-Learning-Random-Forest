# Machine-Learning-Random-Forest
We study the Melbourbe price house from dataset provided on Kaggle.
We work on two methods using Random Forest model.
The first one is about imputing missing data. The second one is about droping columns related to the most missing data and adjust on other columns using imputation.
The second method provides better results for this dataset.
We measure the error using the MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
